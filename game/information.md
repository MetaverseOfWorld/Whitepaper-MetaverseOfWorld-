## HUMANS



MOW protectors, humans have adapted to their environment, enhancing many skills and abilities: strong-back Years of hard work allow more weight to be carried on their hard backs. Humans have increased strength-determined weight-bearing capacity. Carry 60 additional Weight Stones. Tough Accustomed to overcoming adversity, humans regenerate health faster than ever before. They regenerate health points faster than normal. +2 Hit Point Regeneration Workhorse Humans have a better chance of finding more resources when searching for fur, metal, or wood. +1 Logs in Trammel +2 Logs in Felucca +1 ore with random mining Additional skins jack of all trades The curiosity for the things of humans has led to a basic knowledge of what surrounds him.

### BLACKSMITH

Undoubtedly one of the most requested Skills, perform metallurgy works and create weapons and armor with a large amount of ingots, using forges and anvils, small hammers and heavy blacksmith maces, with greater durability. Commonly used in conjunction with Mining Skills and especially "Weapon Knowledge" as add-ons. Basic level weapons can be crafted with certain types of ore, such as silver and shadow. To make weapons with high-end minerals, you need special hammers called "runic", which are obtained by delivering orders (BOD's) in the blacksmiths of the cities. To be able to request these orders, a minimum of 80.0 skill in Blacksmithing is required.

### PALADIN

Skill in handling the shield will allow you to make the most of their blocking power. Shields do not increase the wearer's armor, but instead give the wearer a chance to block hits. A blocked hit will deal no damage. The chance to block a shield can be seen by equipping the shield and using the .stats command. This depends on the quality of the metal with which it has been forged. Iron shields will give a very low chance to block, while an eclipse or invulnerability shield will give a very high chance to block a hit. The maximum blocking in any case will be 45%

### WARRIOR

This ability is similar to Meditation, but it is aimed at warriors, since it allows you to recover mana, life and energy somewhat faster than normal, although its power is less than that of meditation. Usage is passive, so you can't "call" the ability. Every time the character loses mana or energy, the system will check this ability to find out the regeneration speed. This ability goes up by itself, as long as the character's mana and energy are not at maximum. Each creature (including player characters) recovers a number of mana, life, and energy/stamina points every 10 seconds. Some have this value higher than others, but it is always fixed. With this ability that value is variable:

For example, if a player recovers 5 points of energy in 10 seconds while standing still, if he had 20 points in concentration he could recover 7 points in that same time and if we had 100 points of concentration, he would recover 15 points of energy every 10 seconds.

They receive a bonus to their maximum mana. +20 Mana Increase Bonus

### NINJA

This ability allows you to spot marauders moving in the shadows around you. The higher your skill level, the greater your character's "seeing" radius and the greater the chance of finding someone or something hidden. To reveal someone, the target needs to be moving. If you remain still you will not be discovered! The ability is passive, you don't need to do anything to detect another. If for some reason you do not want to reveal someone who is in your radius of action (a friend for example), you can use the command .detect The .detect command will turn this ability on or off.

### SAMURAI

This ability determines the number of steps or time you can stay hidden by walking once hidden with the Hide ability. The higher its value, the more likely you are to remain hidden while you walk. If you have a low value in this ability, the result will be that after a few steps you will be discovered, and it will be more difficult for a character with a lot of weight to hide. You can walk hidden both with and without a mount. A mage with the reveal spell, an npc or a character with the Detect Hidden ability can reveal you if you are hidden. Also if you steal objects from a body you will reveal yourself.

### MAGE

It is the main skill of a mage or a scribe. With this ability, our character can cast different spells, be it damage, healing, protection, invocation... The higher this skill is, the more powerful your character will be able to cast spells. To make them we will need a book of magic, ingredients and intelligence, in addition to mana. Our character can also use scrolls to carry out his spells, casting a spell from a scroll consumes half the mana and does not consume any ingredients, also casting a spell from a scroll requires less magical ability. Your character's magic level will determine the chances of your spell taking effect on the target, the damage will depend solely on your Assess Intelligence ability.Reagents In order to carry out the wizard spells we need a series of ingredients that are collected in the game world, there are the following: reagents In order to carry out the wizard spells we need a series of ingredients that are collected in the game world, there are the following:&#x20;
