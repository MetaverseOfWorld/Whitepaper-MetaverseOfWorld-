# The way to earn money



The MOW is the most important thing in the game and we always have to try not to be short of it if we want to progress, since without MOW, you don't buy weapons, armor and everything you need to go on an adventure. Here are some of the most common ways to get MOW.

\


Collecting garbage: For new characters, an easy way to get MOW is to collect all the objects that other players are throwing around, since everything is bought and sold in MOW, it is just a matter of knowing the appropriate place.

\


**Working**: There are some skills that MOW can provide us, although yes, working for it.&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;tailoring skill we can buy fabric and with it make clothes and then sell them, as well as take advantage of the skins of animals that we kill to make leather armor and other things.&#x20;

\


blacksmith skill we can buy metal ingots and make weapons and armor to sell them or offer our services to repair weapons to other players. With the bowing/fletching skill we can make bows and arrows to sell, etc.

\


Hunting: Going hunting usually brings many benefits, as long as we manage to stay alive long enough, of course. Any animal that we kill can be skinned (by double-clicking on an edged weapon and pointing at the carcass) to obtain its meat, fur, feathers, etc. which we will then sell to get some MOW. If we have more luck and what we find are orcs, trolls, rat-men or any type of monster, we can remove the MOW and the tools they carry. The results of a good hunt are usually good loot.

\


Animal taming: One way I can think of to earn money is by using the animal taming skill, although yes, we must have it very developed to be able to tame large animals. The thing is to tame animals (bears, horses, etc.) and then sell them in town.
