# Special Skill

## MINING

This ability is based on the ability to extract minerals from the bowels of the earth; so that later this mineral can be treated and converted into ingots, which can be used to make both weapons and armor.

## LOGGING

MOW has a number of leafy forests where logging activity can be productive, although there are a few things to know before you start harvesting this raw material. In addition, constant chopping noticeably improves your physical condition as you get used to using the ax so that you can achieve up to a 30% damage bonus in combat with the use of these two-handed weapons.

## FISHING

The fisherman can decide whether to carry out his activity on the coast, from the mainland or if, on the contrary, he prefers to buy a boat to go into the seas, an option that carries more risks although the reward will also be greater.
