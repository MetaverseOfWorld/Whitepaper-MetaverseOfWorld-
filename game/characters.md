### The Races

Each race has their own set of special abilities (in addition to differing physical appearances). They also have access to different types of weapon, armor, and clothing. Following is a brief description of each:

####

## Humans

The first playable race in MOW. Humans naturally heal faster than Elves and Gargoyles and are more adept at basic resource gathering and can carry greater weights. Most significantly, they have the "Jack of All Trades" trait, which provides them a "hidden" minimum of 20 skill points in all skills - even ones they have not trained past 0. Humans are the most widespread race, with kingdoms in MOW.

## Elves

The Elf race hails from Heartwood, and their lives are tied to the wellbeing of all of Sosaria. Due to this Elves are more in touch with nature, granting them a greater ability in locating special resources. Their wisdom imparts an automatic increase to their total Mana as well as a higher natural resistance to energy-based attacks. They also have a higher ability to move without being tracked, and are better able to detect others who are hidden. They also have better eyesight in the darkness, meaning they do not have to make use of the "Night Sight" spell at nighttime or in dungeons as Humans and Gargoyles do.

## Gargoyles

Due to their size, they are not able to ride mounts, but instead rely upon their wings for quicker transportation (see section five for more details). Gargoyles are fierce warriors and are able to do greater damage as they take more damage themselves. They also have greater ability in the Throwing and Mysticism skills, and are more adept at Imbuing weapons with magical properties.
