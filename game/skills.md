# Skills

![](../.gitbook/assets/getting\_started\_skill\_selection.png)

To start, you are presented with pre-selected skill sets that suit a particular type of character. Choosing the "Advanced" option allows you to pick three starting skills and adjust their level as well as the level of your starting Stats (Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity). The starting items and skills you receive are determined by your choice on this screen.

### Gender: Male and Female

There are few major differences between the genders. There are some armor and clothing pieces that are gender-specific, and some mounts can only be ridden by one gender or another.

### Hair, Skin, and Clothing

There are a number of options for each of these traits, all of which can be changed later on during the course of play. Starter clothing provides no protection against attacks, but is provided for modesty's sake. Gargoyles have the options for different styles of horns instead of hair.
